Libraries used:
In order to complete this Technical Task i have used external libraries such as "open in browser", "Live server" and "HTMLHint". These made it easier to identify errors and have a live preview of how my website would look like with each change.

Learning Points:
1. Always remember to put px, usually the case when the codes do not work
2. Having neatly arranged codes and classes makes things easier
3. Always check whether there is error before moving forward 

Thoughts:
The task given really gives a good gasp of the basics of coding. I started off facing difficulty finding a software and a hosting service, and had to go through quite a few hosting services and software before settling on Github (noticed it was used by IONS in Blog examples) and VSCode where they provide live feedback and hosting through local storage. This allowed me to see the pros and cons of each software and hosting service, at the same time I learned a few shortcuts.
